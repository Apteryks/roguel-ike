** Level

   A cell grid.

   Implements the generics:

   | name        | arguments | comment                              |
   |-------------+-----------+--------------------------------------|
   | get-cells   | LEVEL     | Return the cells in the form of a    |
   |             |           | two-dimensional sequence of cell     |
   |             |           | objects.                             |
   |-------------+-----------+--------------------------------------|
   | get-height  | LEVEL     | Retrieve the level's height          |
   |-------------+-----------+--------------------------------------|
   | get-width   | LEVEL     | Retrieve the level's width           |
   |-------------+-----------+--------------------------------------|
   | get-cell-at | LEVEL X Y | Return the cell at the position X, Y |
   |             |           | in the LEVEL                         |



** Cell

   A cell in a level. It can initially be any object.

* ASCII Rendering

  The level renderer can generate a colored ASCII string from a level.

  It has the following slots:

  | name          | type             | comment                                  |
  |---------------+------------------+------------------------------------------|
  | symbols-table | Association list | This maps the different game types       |
  |               |                  | to theirdisplay settings.                |
  |               |                  |                                          |
  |               |                  | Each key in this list is a game type.    |
  |               |                  | A game type is specific to the game,     |
  |               |                  | and can be a simple symbol.              |
  |               |                  |                                          |
  |               |                  | For each key, its value is a cons which  |
  |               |                  | car is the caracter to display for this  |
  |               |                  | type as a string, and cdr is the face to |
  |               |                  | use to display the character.            |
  |               |                  |                                          |
  |               |                  | Example:                                 |
  |               |                  | '((:ground . ("." . face-ground))        |
  |               |                  | (:wall . ("#" . face-wall))              |
  |               |                  | (:hero . ("@" . face-hero)))             |

  It defines the following methods:

  | name         | arguments      | comment                                 |
  |--------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------|
  | render-level | RENDERER LEVEL | Return the level renderer as a          |
  |              |                | colored ASCII string. The most simple   |
  |              |                | use of this string is to be inserted    |
  |              |                | in a buffer.                            |
  |--------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------|
  | render-cell  | RENDERER CELL  | Return the cell rendered as a colored   |
  |              |                | ASCII character.                        |
  |              |                |                                         |
  |              |                | CELL must implement `get-visible-type', |
  |              |                | see below.                              |


** Cell generics

   In order to be renderered, cells must implement these generics:

   | name             | arguments | comment                                     |
   |------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------|
   | get-visible-type | CELL      | Return the type that should be used to      |
   |                  |           | display the cell.                           |
   |                  |           |                                             |
   |                  |           | For a wall, it could be :wall.              |
   |                  |           | For a ground in which the hero is standing, |
   |                  |           | it could be :hero.                          |
   |                  |           | For a cell the player currently doesn't     |
   |                  |           | see, it could be :shadow.                   |

* Field of view computation

  Decide which cells are visible or not in the level from a single point.

  Field of view is done with a function in the form:

  | name        | arguments        | comment                                     |
  |-------------+------------------+---------------------------------------------|
  | compute-fov | LEVEL X Y RADIUS | Compute the field of view in the LEVEL      |
  |             |                  | using X, Y as origin.                       |
  |             |                  |                                             |
  |             |                  | The computation will only consider cells    |
  |             |                  | which distance from field of view origin    |
  |             |                  | is less than RADIUS.                        |
  |             |                  | If RADIUS is nil, there is no distance      |
  |             |                  | restriction in the field of view.           |
  |             |                  |                                             |
  |             |                  | LEVEL's cells must implement                |
  |             |                  | `block-light-p', `set-lit', and may         |
  |             |                  | implement `set-visited'.                    |
  |             |                  |                                             |
  |             |                  | Computing field of view means litting cells |
  |             |                  | that are visible from the origin.           |

  Be careful, field of view computer won't set all other cells unlit. It will
  only lit cells that are visible. It is up to the user to unlit all other cells
  before computing field of view.


** Cell generics

   In order to apply the field of view, cells must implement these generics:

   | name          | arguments | comment                                |
   |---------------+-----------+----------------------------------------|
   | block-light-p | CELL      | Return t when the cells behing CELL    |
   |               |           | should not be lit.                     |
   |---------------+-----------+----------------------------------------|
   | set-lit       | CELL LIT  | Unlit the cell when LIT is nil, lit it |
   |               |           | otherwise.                             |

   Additionnally to these generics, cells may implement:

   | name        | arguments    | comment                                       |
   |-------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------|
   | set-visited | CELL VISITED | When VISITED is non-nil, tells that           |
   |             |              | the cell has already been lit, even in        |
   |             |              | a previous fov computation.                   |
   |             |              |                                               |
   |             |              | This method is useful to register the level   |
   |             |              | layout. Without this flag, as cell is either  |
   |             |              | lit or unlit. visited can make the difference |
   |             |              | between a cell that have never been           |
   |             |              | discovered, an a cell previously discovered   |
   |             |              | currently unlit.                              |

* Line of sight

  Line of sight can tell wether a point A can see a point B in a level.
  It is implemented as a function in the form:

  | name      | arguments           | comment                                 |
  |-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------|
  | can-see-p | ORIGIN TARGET LEVEL | Return t if ORIGIN can see TARGET       |
  |           |                     | in the LEVEL.                           |
  |           |                     |                                         |
  |           |                     | ORIGIN and TARGET are conses in the     |
  |           |                     | form (x . y).                           |
  |           |                     |                                         |
  |           |                     | To do its job, can-see-p requires cells |
  |           |                     | to implement `block-light-p'.           |

* Path finding

  The role of this module is to find a path from one point to another
  in a level. It is implemented as a function in the form:

  | name      | arguments                | comment                               |
  |-----------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------|
  | find-path | ORIGIN TARGET LEVEL COST | Find the sequence of contiguous cells |
  |           |                          | to go from ORIGIN to TARGET in LEVEL. |
  |           |                          |                                       |
  |           |                          | ORIGIN and TARGET are conses in the   |
  |           |                          | form (x . y).                         |
  |           |                          |                                       |
  |           |                          | COST is a function that takes 4       |
  |           |                          | arguments:                            |
  |           |                          |                                       |
  |           |                          | ORIGIN-POINT ORIGIN-CELL              |
  |           |                          | TARGET-POINT TARGET-CELL              |
  |           |                          |                                       |
  |           |                          | and return the cost to go from        |
  |           |                          | ORIGIN-CELL located at ORIGIN-POINT   |
  |           |                          | to TARGET-CELL located at             |
  |           |                          | TARGET-POINT, assuming these cells    |
  |           |                          | are contiguous.                       |
  |           |                          |                                       |
  |           |                          | If COST return nil, it means that     |
  |           |                          | TARGET-CELL is unreachable.           |
  |           |                          |                                       |
  |           |                          | The function return the list of       |
  |           |                          | points that allows to go to TARGET at |
  |           |                          | the least cost regarding the values   |
  |           |                          | of the COST function. The points are  |
  |           |                          | ordered from the nearest from ORIGIN  |
  |           |                          | to TARGET.                            |
